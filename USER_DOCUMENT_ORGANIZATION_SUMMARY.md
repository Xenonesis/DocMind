# User Document Organization Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a system to save user uploaded documents organized by their signed-in email addresses. This ensures that each user's documents are stored separately and securely.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Updated `supabase-development-schema.sql` to ensure documents table has proper `user_id` foreign key
- Modified document table structure to match the application's needs

### 2. TypeScript Types
- Updated `Document` interface in `src/lib/supabase-types.ts` to include `userId` field
- Added `getDocumentsByUserId` function to database utilities

### 3. File Storage Organization
**New Structure:**
```
public/uploads/users/{sanitized-email}/documents/{document-id}/{filename}
```

**Example:**
```
public/uploads/users/john.doe@example.com/documents/abc123/report.pdf
public/uploads/users/jane_smith@company.com/documents/def456/presentation.pptx
```

### 4. Upload API Changes (`src/app/api/documents/upload/route.ts`)
- Added user authentication extraction from request headers
- Modified file paths to organize by user email
- Updated both Supabase storage and local filesystem fallback to use user-organized structure
- Added user creation/lookup logic to ensure documents are properly associated

### 5. Document Retrieval Updates
- **Documents API** (`src/app/api/documents/route.ts`): Now filters documents by current user
- **Preview API** (`src/app/api/documents/[id]/preview/route.ts`): Updated to handle user-organized file paths
- **Dashboard** (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`): Added authentication headers to API requests

### 6. Frontend Authentication
- **Document Upload** (`src/components/document-upload.tsx`): Added auth token to upload requests
- **Dashboard**: Added auth token to document fetching requests

## Security Features

### 1. User Isolation
- Each user can only see and access their own documents
- File paths are organized by user email to prevent cross-user access

### 2. Email Sanitization
- Special characters in email addresses are replaced with underscores for safe file system paths
- Example: `user+test@domain.com` becomes `user_test@domain.com`

### 3. Authentication Required
- All document operations require valid Supabase authentication
- Fallback to anonymous user for development/testing scenarios

## Backward Compatibility
The system maintains backward compatibility by checking multiple possible file paths:
1. New user-organized path: `users/{email}/documents/{id}/{filename}`
2. Legacy document path: `documents/{id}/{filename}`
3. Legacy root path: `{filename}`
4. Storage reference path from metadata

## File Access Flow

### Upload Process
1. User uploads file through authenticated frontend
2. System extracts user email from Supabase session
3. File is saved to user-specific directory structure
4. Database record includes user association
5. Metadata includes user email for reference

### Retrieval Process
1. User requests document list
2. System filters documents by authenticated user ID
3. File preview/download uses user-organized paths
4. Fallback to legacy paths for older documents

## Benefits
- **Privacy**: Users can only access their own documents
- **Organization**: Clear file system structure by user
- **Scalability**: Easy to manage large numbers of users and documents
- **Security**: Prevents accidental cross-user data access
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of user data

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Sign in with different user accounts
2. Upload documents with each user
3. Verify documents are stored in user-specific directories
4. Confirm users can only see their own documents
5. Test document preview and download functionality
